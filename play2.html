        <p>Arthur, do you
        think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
        against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
        ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the
        time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
        unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
        one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
        mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
        worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
        </p>
